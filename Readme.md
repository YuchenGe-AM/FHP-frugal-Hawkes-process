R programs for frugal Hawkes processes.

1. Simulation_Preparation.R prepares necessary functions for simulation of the frugal Hawkes processes.
2. Inference_Preparation.R prepares necessary functions for inference of the frugal Hawkes processes.
2. Simulation_Methods.R simulates frugal Hawkes processes with copula/thinning/marginal modelling based methods.
5. Simulation_Test_X.R measures the behavior of each simulation algorithm with ks/cvm/ad tests through random time change theorem.
6. Inference_MLE.R implements the inference algorithm for frugal Hawkes processes.
