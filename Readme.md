These are the R programs for frugal Hawkes processes.

1. Simulation_PreparationX.R, writes necessary functions for simulation and inference of the processes.
2. Simulation_Copulas.R simulates frugal Hawkes processes with copulas.
3. Simulation_Thinning.R simulates frugal Hawkes processes with computed intensities.
4. Simulation_Marginal.R simulates frugal Hawkes processes with marginal point processes separately.
5. Simulation_Test_X.R measures the behavior of each simulation algorithm with KS tests through random time change theorem.
6. Inference_X.R implments the inference algorithm for frugal hawkes processes.
