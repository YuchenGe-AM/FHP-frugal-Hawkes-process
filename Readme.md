# R for frugal Hawkes processes

1.  Simulation_Preparation.R prepares necessary functions for simulation of the frugal Hawkes processes.
2.  Inference_Preparation.R prepares necessary functions for inference of the frugal Hawkes processes.
3.  Simulation_Methods.R simulates frugal Hawkes processes with copula/thinning/marginal modelling based methods.
4.  Simulation_Test.R compares the performance of different simulation algorithms with ks/cvm/ad tests via random time change theorem.
5.  Inference_MLE.R implements the inference algorithm for frugal Hawkes processes.
6.  Hypothesis_Testing.R performs hypothesis test via simulation.
